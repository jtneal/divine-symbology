The swastika must be present in all Jain temples and holy texts, and rituals often start and conclude with the creation of the symbol using rice. The swastika's four arms stand for the four potential afterlife locations for a soul in samsara, the cycle of birth and death: Svarga (\"heaven\"), Naraka (\"hell\"), Manushya (\"humanity\"), or Tiryancha (\"as flora or wildlife\"). The Ratnatraya (three jewels) of Jainism are symbolized by the three dots that sit atop the swastika. The arc represents Siddhashila, a location in the highest regions of the universe made of pure energy. Siddhashila is higher than heaven, earth, or hell. It is the location where saved souls, such as Arihants and Siddhas, dwell eternally in the highest state of joy.",
