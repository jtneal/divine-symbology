Of course, success depends on the individual abilities of each of us, but by praying to the Angel we get the opportunity to realize our abilities, our talents, our desires and projects. HARAHEL deals with the externalization of our moral purpose (or project). This is how our moral content will serve as the basis for the elaboration of our feelings; the person will boast an avant-garde morality, destined to be put into practice in the distant future. Applied to today’s behavior, it will be an irruption of the future in the present. From a practical point of view, this behavior (noble at the origin) can be configured as an outrageous idealism, let’s say out of place; in fact it happens that, due to its sublime character, it is used in an attempt to improve, to bring pimento to falsely spiritual, unpleasant-tasting nourishment. Therefore HARAHEL is a kind of funnel applied to Divine Thought; He is too close to material reality to be able to exert influences inherent in spirituality. Angelic essence: INTELLECTUAL WEALTH.

It is the solar Angel of the Lunar Choir of Angels. Through him, these two stars live a love story; Tradition affirms that this Angel is the bearer of an immense clarity that allows us to rediscover what was once lost. From a philosophical point of view, what man has lost is the other himself, the part dismembered by him at the time of the separation of the sexes (originally Humans were created hermaphrodites, Man – Woman). This Angel balances our male and female tendencies and this balance will manifest itself externally through Fame and Fortune. The person will live in harmony with the Divine Order and will work so that everything develops according to this order. Therefore, he will be successful as a notary, dealing with succession, or as a lawyer, resolving conflicts, since he will possess a deep (innate) knowledge of the law and the Order.

Through invocation it is possible to obtain: sincere friendships, travels, pleasures and honest amusements. It is the solar aspect of the energies of Mercury (ruled by the Archangel MICHAEL). The Traditional Text reports that one can use him to understand physics, astrology and to know oneself. Before acting, the UMABEL protege must consult his interior, because the Angel will communicate with him through his conscience; by doing so, the individual will be able to understand what his Guardian thinks and will easily learn Mathematical Sciences, Physics and Astrology (an important point because, if Astronomy is an easy subject, Astrology – understood as the study of the mechanics that regulate the functioning of the Universe, of Societies and of Man – it is rather difficult to learn). The UMABEL protege has a very sensitive heart, a large sunny heart, a heart that has reasons that reason ignores, a heart full of good presentiments that will become reality, successes. UMABEL has the task of stimulating in the moral personality of the individual what is useful for the situation that the latter is experiencing; he is delegated to form around the subject a sort of armor, or skeleton, capable of accommodating the Drawing being elaborated. If UMABEL did not exist, if there was not an Angel in charge of filling the void that is created within people, when what we usually define as its (intellectual) treasure enters into circulation, the subject in question would find it impoverished. Nonetheless, the gold that the person gives without any calculation will be returned to him thanks to the good offices of UMABEL. Thus we will have the theoretical moralist, the one who preaches what, however, he has never experienced on his own. In exceptional cases, however, it is possible that the preacher is the bearer of a baggage of Divine Drawings, acquired in the course of numerous previous incarnations.

The Traditional Text says that the person can do very well in the military career, because his Angel will suggest the best way to express his desire to fight. Even in civilian life, his protégé will be combative, thanks to the presence of his Guardian alone, but the latter will never lend him a hand (unless you ask him a lot) because, even if the person’s struggles are legal, they risk to be illegitimate from the cosmic point of view and to generate a Karma to be paid for in a future existence, which would slow down the evolution of the person. In any case, the person must not give up on experiencing strong emotions, but, during and after his gesture, he must pray to the Guardian Angel. YELAHIAH makes the image of the Divine Lamb appear within Men: that slaughtered Lamb who protects us from catastrophes as happened in Egypt, when the doors of the houses were smeared with his blood to prevent the Angel of Death from killing the firstborn. The Cosmic Design (or the Creator’s project) is internalized on Earth through YELAHIAH and the Archangels CAMAEL and RAFFAELE and the death of Jesus Christ constitutes the staging of this dynamic, of this interiorization. Thanks to the influence of YELAHIAH, what is located HIGH will appear LOW. We are the bearers of a fragment of Heaven, and our mission is to transplant it to Earth.

    "description": "For fans of horror movies, the bat has become an animal to be feared; the vampire bat is a satanic agent that sucks the soul from the body along with its lifeblood. However, there is more to the bat than purely negative symbolism. In China, the ideogram for good luck, “fu,” sounds the same as the word for “bat” and so the animal is a lucky charm. Some bat caves in the East have remained unchanged for thousands of years; the bats that live there are revered as sacred animals. The nocturnal nature of the bat has given it some negative associations. It is symbolic of the night devouring the day; the bat is said to swallow the light because it wakes at dusk, the time between day and night. Christian belief, too, regards the bat with suspicion because it is seen as an incarnation of Satan. However, the nocturnal nature of the bat makes it, like the owl, a creature that has access to hidden knowledge and secret information, able to detect things in the hours of darkness that are not accessible to diurnal creatures. Before echolocation was recognized and understood, the bat’s ability to find its way about was a source of great intrigue, adding to the mystique of the animal.",

    "description": "For the Celts, “bear” was synonymous with “warrior.” The name of the greatest Celtic king, Arthur, shares the same root as the name for bear—“artos”—meaning “bearlike.” This warrior-bear attribute was not restricted to the male; in the kingdom of the Gauls, there was a ferocious warrior-queen called Artio. The Greek Goddess of the Hunt, Artemis, also shares the bear’s name. The bear is an earthy creature, and in Northern European pre-Christian society, it represented worldly power and authority, the equivalent of the lion in other societies. The bear is associated with the Moon. As the Moon disappears for a time, so does the bear, when he hibernates during the winter months. Diana/Artemis, the Goddess of the Hunt (who also has close links to the Moon), is often depicted with a bear, and can shape-shift into the form of a bear. The constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor—the Great Bear and the Little Bear—are the stellar incarnation of this Goddess. These constellations are always visible in the northern hemisphere, and so are effective markers for the seasons. The Finno-Ugric people made graveyards for bears until relatively recently. They laid out the bones of the bears very carefully, so that the animal could return from the dead. The power of the bear is borne out by the fact that the actual word for the animal was seldom used, replaced with other terms such as “the brown one” or “bruin,” “the old fellow” or “honey eater.” This is because the power inherent in names was such that to say the name of the animal was equivalent to invoking its spirit. Native Americans have a specific kind of witch doctor called a Bear Doctor, able to take on the form of a grizzly to vanquish the tribal enemies.",

    "description": "The sacred stature of the bull dates back to at least 3000 BC, when early Hebrews carved the effigy of a God, called El, who appeared in the shape of a bull, at the end of their ritual staffs. The bull is the archetype of brute masculinity, fecundity, tyranny, and ferocity. The bull also has its part to play in the story of Hercules and his monumental labors. A bull that is wreaking havoc on Crete tests Hercules’ huge strength. He strangles the bull into submission, and it is shipped away to Athens. Bull sacrifice is such an ancient rite that any definitive origins are uncertain, and although in the Ellora Caves there is a painting of the Goddess Kali slaying a bull, its ritual slaughter is far older than the purported age of the painting (c.AD 500–1000) suggests. To ancient man, the bull was such a supremely powerful animal that being splashed in its blood conferred immortality. In Rome, a bull cult introduced from Asia Minor in the second century BC inspired a ritual called the taurobolium. The initiate stood in a trench, immediately below a board with holes pierced in it. A bull, standing on top of the trench, had its throat slit, and the hot blood gushed down through the slats, drenching the devotee. This gory ritual was the reenactment of a Mithraic legend about the bull’s blood as the origins of all life, and so rejuvenated the body and soul. A remnant of the earlier bull sacrifice still takes place today, in the Spanish bullfights that have become synonymous with the country and its people. This particular ritual is a throwback to the same Mithraic legend as the taurobolium. This legend says the bull was the first creature on Earth. Mithras killed the bull and all other living things sprang from the blood that was spilled on the ground. Many of the oldest bullrings in Spain are on the sites of former Mithraic temples or at least are very close to them. Spain is not the only country to have bullrings; they also exist in South America and France. The bull is immortalized in the night sky, being one of the symbols of the astrological Zodiac in the form of the constellation Taurus.",

    "description": "Unlike the bee that goes from flower to flower with a great sense of purpose and intention, the butterfly seems to flutter about quite aimlessly, no great ambition lurking behind its beauty. In view of the fact that the Greek word for butterfly, psyche, is the same as that for soul, it is interesting to note that winged creatures are universally thought to be able to communicate with other worlds and higher powers. There was a belief that human souls incarnated into butterflies between lifetimes. The connection between the spirit and the butterfly reaches across the world—from the Celts, who believed that the butterfly was a human soul in search of a mother, to the Aztecs, who believed that the last breath exhaled by a dying person took the form of a butterfly. The lifecycle of the butterfly is highly visible at every stage, making it a symbol of transformation. Some Native Americans—particularly the Blackfoot—believe that the butterfly brings dreams. If a Blackfoot Indian paints a butterfly onto the wall of a tribal lodge, it is an indicator that any other patterns painted or drawn there were not simply the work of a man alone, but were inspired by the Great Spirit, for whom the painter acted merely as a conduit.",

    "description": "Even the most common household moggie has a mystique about it and the potential for the supernatural powers that man has ascribed to cats for thousands of years. Typically, in Western civilizations, the cat (particularly if it is black) belongs to the witch; it is her familiar, her companion, and her alter ego. As such, the cat shares magical secrets and arcane knowledge which, of course, she cannot explain to mere mortals, since they don’t speak her language. There is an unspoken communication between the witch and her grimalkin that transcends any language used by other creatures. The Ancient Egyptians regarded the cat so highly that they revered it as a deity. Bast was the cat goddess, and mortal cats whose fur was of three different colors, or who had eyes of different shades, were honored in particular for their Bast-like appearance; it is not just the black cat that holds power. Egyptian priests believed that cats carried the magnetic forces of nature and so close proximity to the creatures enabled them to access these powers. If a cat died a natural death in the home, the Egyptians would shave their eyebrows as a sign of mourning. However, the cat does not have such an honorable reputation everywhere, for example in the Buddhist tradition. Because it was absent at the physical death and spiritual liberation of the Buddha, it is viewed with suspicion as a base, earthly creature, lacking respect. The only other creature that was not there was the serpent. The link between the cat and the serpent comes in the Kabbalah, too, and also in Christianity; in pictures where the cat appears at the feet of Christ it carries the same negative imagery as the snake. Although black cats are the archetypal good-luck symbol in the West, in Islam the opposite is true. Cats are regarded favorably unless they are black, in which case they are viewed with great suspicion since djinn can transform themselves into black cats. In the Western tradition of cat lore, the animal has nine lives, whereas its Eastern cousin has to manage with only seven.",

    "description": "Because of its milk that is a staple food for many human beings, the cow is arguably one of the most useful animals in the world. It was one of the first animals domesticated by humans, and its symbolic importance is rich. It is emblematic of fertility, abundance, wealth, the universal Mother, and of rebirth. The cow is also a gentle and compliant creature. It is not surprising that the cow is universally thought of as a mother figure. In Egypt the cow was personified as Ahet, the mother of the Sun itself. To make themselves fertile Egyptian women wore amulets of the Goddess Hathor, with the head of a cow, in her guise as Creatrix. In Europe, too, the cow was the mother-ancestor of all living things, called Audumla, the milch-cow. In Greek myth, one of the names for the Great Cow was Europa, which means “full Moon.” The stars were said to be the children of Europa. Curiously, the cow was also considered a psychopomp, a creature able to conduct the souls of the dead to the Underworld. The psychopomp aspect of the cow is still celebrated in the Nepali festival called the Gai Jatra or cow festival. In a boisterous celebration, every family that has lost a member during the course of the year has to take part in a procession, leading a cow, or, if no animal is available, then a child dressed in a cow costume is considered to be a fair substitute. The cow is believed to guide the soul on its final journey, including a voyage through the Milky Way, the constellations of stars said to be the milk splashed by the Great Cow that was the Mother of the Universe. The cow as a sacred animal is a fundamental part of Hindu iconography. In India the cow is so revered, and treated so gently, that it often causes a traffic hazard as it ambles along busy city roads. There are several reasons for the sacred status given to the creature. Not only does the Hindu faith have respect for all animals (vegetarianism is a tenet of the faith), but the God Krishna was a cowherd for a time, and one of his names is Bala Gopala, “the child who protects the cows.” Hindu deities rule over each and every part of the cow. During times of famine, the cow is far more useful as a creature that can produce limitless amounts of milk, than as a dead beast that would provide meat for a limited period only.",

Because coyotes can be heard howling at night, they are often associated with the Moon. The coyote is one of the sacred animals that can open the door to the other world and it acts as a messenger between this world and the next. The coyote is sometimes held responsible for all the evils of the world, and in the countries where it makes its home it is generally a symbol of bad luck.",

Whenever a deer appears in folklore, it usually signifies a profound change. The deer’s antlers are one of the characteristics that have made it the figure of a spiritual superiority, according to some. Like a crown, the antlers grow beyond its body, bringing it closer to the sky and making it sacred. In many cultures, the deer is a symbol of spiritual authority. During a deer’s life the antlers fall off and grow again and the animal is also a symbol of regeneration. In the Christian imagination, the deer is a symbol of piety, devotion and of God taking care of his children.",

    "description": "One of the traditional pet names for the dog, Fido, comes from the same Latin root as the word “fidelity,” and the trust and faith that a dog and its owner invest in one another is a defining feature of their relationship. For thousands of years man and dog have been close companions, living together, working together, and forming a close bond of mutual understanding. Every society has its dog mythology, its deities, and its symbols. The dog is often the companion of a God, too, in addition to being a psychopomp, guiding the souls of the dead to the next world. On a more earthly level the animal can be a guide dog or a guard dog, directing and protecting, one of the greatest allies known to humankind; man’s best friend, indeed. The dog’s keen sense of smell takes on almost supernatural connotations, a skill denied humans and something that cannot be seen or detected by us. This is part of the reason why the dog acts as mediator between the seen and unseen worlds, seemingly gifted the powers of second sight and psychic abilities. The Egyptians were very keen that their corpses would smell as sweet as possible so as not to offend the sensitive nose of the jackal-headed God Anubis, who shepherded these souls through to their next dwelling place. While some witches have cats as familiars, others have their dogs, in honor of the Goddesses of Death and their hounds. Hecate, the Goddess of the Underworld and the Queen of Witches, had her dogs; like the Devil, she haunted crossroads, her pack of hounds at her feet. Latterly Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s shape-shifting godfather, keeps a close eye on his charge by changing into a great black dog. Sirius, of course, is named after the Dog Star. It is a telling sign among humans that often the animals with the greatest cultural and symbolic significance are the ones that it is considered wrong to eat. The majority of the world sees the eating of dog flesh as a great taboo.",

    "description": "The dolphin has become ubiquitous as a symbol of the so-called New Age, due in part to its benevolently smiling appearance, its intelligence, its ability to communicate verbally with others of its kind, and the fact that it’s a mammal that is comfortable in an environment normally reserved for fishes. The name comes from the Greek delphinos, meaning “womb.” The name of the Delphic Oracle where the priestesses gave their prophecies holds the same root; the temple was dedicated to Apollo, who arrived at Delphi in the shape of a dolphin. For thousands of years the dolphin has been considered a helpful friend to humankind. It also acts as a psychopomp or guide to the other world. This is a fitting role for the dolphin given its ability to exist in a dimension alien to humans and because it has been seen to save those who might otherwise have drowned. The dolphin is symbolic of metamorphosis. There is a Greek legend about some pirates who, after capturing Dionysus and tying him up, fell overboard and turned into dolphins. In its role as the saver of souls, the dolphin is compared to Christ and also to the Roman Sun God Mithras, whose worship was superseded by that of the new God of Christianity.",

Water is closely linked to the womb, and the idea of birth and rebirth, and so the fish takes on this meaning too. Because it quite literally has access to hidden depths, the fish is party to secret and sacred information—the Vedas, which are said to contain all arcane knowledge, were delivered by a fish acting as the avatar of Vishnu. Similarly for the Celts, the salmon was a fish associated with wisdom and hidden knowledge. Christ chose from fishermen for his disciples, and early Christians, who had to keep their religion a secret, identified one another by a piscine symbol called the Ichthys. Fish can lay vast numbers of eggs and therefore are symbolic of fertility and life. In the East, a pair of fish is used as a lucky charm in wedding ceremonies. There is an astrological sign that features two fish swimming in opposite directions—Pisces—and in Buddhism, a pair of golden fish is one of the Eight Auspicious Symbols.",

    "description": "Wiliness, slyness and cunning, craftiness, trickery and guile, and yet wisdom too: these are all the qualities that are generally accepted throughout the world as belonging to the fox. An intelligent animal, Reynard, the famous fox that appears in fairy tales, has human characteristics and often converses with men and women in their own language. The first recorded instance of hunting the fox with hounds is from the sixteenth century, but the tradition is supposed to be much older. Although the animal was hunted for its beautiful pelt, the actual chase often turned into an escapade that resulted in a slaughter so bloody that the fur itself was rendered completely useless. The reason for the persecution of this creature, beyond mere straightforward culling, remains a mystery, although it may stem from early Christian belief that made the fox synonymous with that most cunning of tricksters, the Devil. Because foxes live in holes and tunnels in the ground, they are attached to the Earth element and accordingly are the totem animals of several earth deities. The fox is also the symbol of the seducer or, most dangerously, the seductress; the “foxy lady” is aptly described. The fox is the totem animal of Dionysus, whose seductively foxy priestesses wore fox skins.",

In this story, the frog is a symbol of transformation. The frog is a transformational creature in real life, too, and because the life cycle of this amphibious creature is carried out in such a visible manner it is a reminder of resurrection and the cycle of life, of birth, death, and rebirth. Egyptian mummies were wrapped with amulets depicting the image of the frog as a charm to help the person’s soul to be reborn. The frog’s links with water are obvious, and it often appears on rain charms. In Ancient China, the frog’s image appeared on the drums that were played to summon thunder, the herald of much- needed rain. In Egypt, the frog symbolizes fertility (because of its enthusiastic mating habits and abundant spawn) and so they were sacred to Hekit, the Midwife of the Gods. “Frog” has become the English-speakers’ nickname for the French, who notoriously eat frogs’ legs as a delicacy. Indeed, before the French ruling classes adopted the Fleur de Lys as their emblem, the frog was France’s national symbol.",

    "description": "For millennia the horse has enjoyed a spiritual, symbolic, and mythical significance that arguably surpasses that of any other living creature. Accordingly, its symbolic significance is massive and varied. That the horse has long enjoyed a vital link with humankind as a hunting companion, a beast of burden, as a means of travel, and as an agricultural asset is demonstrated by its image being seen in Paleolithic cave drawings, such as at Lascaux, dating back approximately 30,000 years. The horse belongs to the Sun and the element of fire. Horses proudly draw the chariot of the Sun God. At the same time, the horse also belongs to the Moon and the element of water, since it carries on its back the God of the Oceans, too. It was believed that where a horse stamped, a spring appeared, and so the animal became a life-giver. In Greece there is a sacred well, called Hippocrene (the Horse’s Well), which is shaped like a horseshoe and is dedicated to the Muses. Pegasus, the Winged Horse, was held to have created this particular sacred well. The horse symbolizes life and death, darkness and light, good and evil, depending on the context in which it is seen. As well as being a bringer of life, it is also a psychopomp, a creature that guides dead souls on the journey to the next life. As well as having spiritual significance, like the dog with which shares many characteristics, the horse is valuable in purely practical terms, too. It represents power and wealth, since having a horse—or many horses—confers superiority on the owner, not only in terms of monetary value but in the distances he is able to cover and the speeds at which he can travel. This leads to another aspect of the horse—it is a symbol of freedom. Horses were used by warriors and so are linked with Mars, the God of War, and with all the associated male attributes: virility, sexuality, and strength. Wotan/Odin’s horse, Sleipnir, had supernatural powers, possessing eight legs as well as being able to gallop over water as though it were solid land. Horse Goddesses include Epona, the mother-Goddess of the ancient Britons, and Rhiannon. The sacred status of horses meant that the sacrifice of such a creature was a rare and profound event, and even today, there is repugnance among many people at the thought of eating horseflesh; not eating an animal is a sure sign that it is regarded as sacred.",

    "description": "To Native Americans, the name of the jaguar is synonymous with a creature that “kills with one blow,” while the word “panther” comes from the Greek panthera, meaning “all beast,” showing just how important our ancestors considered this animal to be. The Mayans believed that, since the dawn of time, four jaguars guarded the entrance to their valuable maize fields. Since these people followed a lunar calendar, the jaguar, a nocturnal creature, connected to their Goddess of the Moon, who is sometimes depicted with the claws of this great cat. Its association with the night and therefore occult knowledge gave the jaguar the gift of second sight and prophecy, which explains why it sometimes appears depicted with four eyes, two for normal sight and two for supernatural vision. The jaguar was one of the major deities of the Mayans, appearing on their calendars, and venerated in the form of the Jaguar Priests who officiated at only the most important and sacred rites and rituals. The Incas, too, revered this big cat and built temples in its honor. While the jaws of the jaguar were emblematic of the gates of Heaven, it was also considered to be the Lord of the Underworld, no doubt because of its ability to kill swiftly and surely, and was therefore one of the many creatures with the sacred responsibility of guiding souls to the world beyond. In the same way that the lion and the eagle are juxtaposed in many cultures, the jaguar was similarly aligned with this bird, which was called the “jaguar of the skies.” Gods and kings wore the skins and feathers of sacred animals as status symbols, and the Aztec Emperor sat on a throne of eagle feathers and jaguar skin. The animal carries the same powers of creation and destruction as the fire that, legend says, it brought to humankind.",

    "description": "It might seem odd that the adult version of the lamb—the sheep—carries quite negative symbolism, as a creature that blindly runs with the flock, unable to think as an individual. However, the lamb is a much more positive symbol. It stands for innocence and purity, the spiritual, the compliant, and gentleness. Further, the lamb is a symbol of spring, of new hope, and of triumph over adversity. The first lamb of the season, as the most potent personification of these qualities, was usually sacrificed to the Gods. The sacrificial nature of the lamb carries resonance through the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faiths. Hence, the symbolism of the Christ as the Lamb of God, sacrificed for all mankind but resurrected by a beneficent God. There is a specific symbol, the Paschal Lamb, which perfectly embodies this notion; the lamb appears with a halo and a banner, symbolizing both sanctity and victory. The lamb is also a symbol of peace, and where it appears with the dove, this aspect is compounded. Sometimes the lamb and the lion appear together, a universal symbol of concord and harmony and the balancing of opposites.",

    "description": "One of the most powerful animals and appropriately laden with rich symbolic meaning, the lion is synonymous with the Sun, and as such is best personified as Leo, the Zodiac sign that has the great golden star as its ruler. The lion even looks like the Sun, with its tawny coat and shaggy golden mane. The lion is the totem animal of kings and emperors, of Apollo, of Mithras, of Christ, of Krishna, of the Buddha. Its counterpart, the eagle, is called the Lion of the Skies. Christ is known as the Lion of Judah, and Mohammed’s son-in-law, Ali, who acted as mediator between the Prophet and the people, was called the Lion of Allah. Krishna is known as the “Lion among Wild Creatures” and the Buddha is the “Lion of the Shakyas.” The lion, with its shaggy halo of a mane, might seem to be the ultimate personification of male energy. However, there are female deities who share the attributes of the lion, and the lioness is a ferociously protective mother. Hathor, the Egyptian Goddess, has the head of a lion when she appears in the aspect of Destroyer. Cybele, the Phrygian Earth Mother, rides in a chariot pulled by lions, and the lion, as well as the bee, was sacred to her. There is a negative side, however, to the great power of the lion. It is no accident that the collective noun for a group of lions is a “pride,” and the sin of pride is said to be the negative aspect of the Zodiac sign of Leo. Further, power can lead to corruption unless there is an awareness of moral and ethical values. The male lion can also be a symbol of laziness, and it is a well-known fact that the lioness is the one who does the majority of the hunting and cub-care.",

It is also a good mimic, although it is not always certain that the animal understands precisely what it is imitating; in this sense the monkey is a symbol of randomness. A recurrent theme of the monkey is as an emblem of chaotic, unguided, unconscious action. In the Ramayana, it is a monkey called Hanuman who helps Vishnu rescue his bride from a demon, and is deified as a reward. The monkey is a sexually active, fertile creature, and in India women are known to strip off their clothes and hug the effigy of Hanuman in the belief that this will help them to conceive. Monkeys also have a propensity for anger, and the Egyptians, recognizing this, used the hieroglyphic symbol of the monkey to mean “angry.” In the Mayan calendar, too, the monkey held prominence, regarded as hard working, a gifted orator, and talented at artistic pursuits in general. To call someone a monkey was considered to be a great compliment.

In Europe, the mouse was symbolic of the soul leaving the body, an idea shared by other tiny creatures. It was believed that the soul/mouse escaped through the mouth as the dying person breathed their last breath. This supposition was so well founded that it even has witness reports. The mouse also appears with the great elephant-headed Indian God Ganesh. Curiously, the huge Ganesh is described as “riding” this tiny animal.

The pig is regarded as ignorant, gluttonous, and selfish, an animal that wallows in its own filth (notwithstanding the fact that the animal is actually extremely clean and scrupulous), one of the animals considered “unclean” by both Hebrews and Muslims and which is forbidden as food to followers of these faiths. To throw “pearls before swine” is to offer something to someone who is unable to appreciate it. In Tibetan Buddhism, the pig represents worldly desire in all its forms—lust, material possessions, food. It sits at the center of the Wheel of Dharma as a symbol of things that tie us to the cycle of materialism, holding us back from spiritual enlightenment. However, there’s another side to the coin. All animals that were considered holy or sacred were also forbidden to be eaten, and the pig, too, despite its negative connotations, held sacred status, linked to the Mother Goddess in lots of different faith systems. The sow is a prolific mother, giving birth to many piglets. The fecundity of this creature means that she is associated with Demeter/Ceres, the Earth Goddess and mother of the harvest. To Hindus, as Varahi, she is the boar-faced Goddess who protects holy buildings. Durga, also, takes on the form of the pig as Vajrabarahi. The Egyptian Goddess of the Night, Nut, was depicted on amulets as a sow being suckled by her piglets. The Celtic Mother Goddess, Ceridwen, was called the Old White Sow, and both the deity and the pig were associated with the Moon. Only the Gods were considered worthy to eat the meat of the pig. In China, the pig is one of the auspicious animal signs of the Chinese Zodiac, where it symbolizes hard work, love of family, and a caring nature.

Although the rabbit didn’t make its appearance in the British Isles until the twelfth century, its prolific breeding habits meant that it was soon prevalent everywhere and it adopted a little of the same symbolic meaning as the hare, minus the mystery accorded the hare as the more elusive nocturnal creature. Because of its fecundity and gregarious nature, the rabbit is a symbol of love and peace for some Native Americans. There is a courtship ritual called the Rabbit Dance. The rabbit’s foot is still seen by some as a particularly potent good-luck charm. While having its foot severed is presumably not very lucky for the rabbit itself, as a totem object the foot is believed to bless its owner with the same fertility and swift-footedness as the animal. The efficacy of the piece of rabbit worn as a charm did not escape the Lakota warriors, who believed that an armband of its skin would enable them to run as fast as the rabbit itself.",

Modern Egyptians still believe that dried and powdered scarabs will help them to become fertile. However, it is as the sacred animal belonging to the God of the Rising Sun, Khepera, that the scarab is important. The Ancient Egyptians observed that the scarab beetle rolled its own ball of dung along the ground in the same way that the Khepera rolled the Sun across the sky. They also believed that the scarab hatched itself from this dung ball, symbolizing death and rebirth. As a God, the scarab was depicted with the wings, legs, and tail of a falcon. The scarab was placed on top of the heart when a corpse was mummified. This was so that the heart, symbolizing the conscience, would not be able to speak because the scarab was in the way. Therefore, the soul could say nothing that might otherwise hinder its access to the Afterlife. Such was the power of the scarab that its image appears everywhere in Ancient Egyptian art and artifacts, on seals and amulets and on pieces of jewelry. The prominence of the scarab for the Egyptians, however, seems to be a very recent trend when we realize that the beetle has been an important symbol since the Paleolithic period, between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago.",

Whenever this happens we know that an animal is particularly potent. The scorpion is constantly prepared to attack, the sting in its tail always unsheathed. As such, the insect is the embodiment of brute aggression. This aggression is further promulgated by the fact that the female scorpion will only ever give birth once; her progeny have the grisly habit of destroying their mother by digging their way out of her belly. The scorpion was a hieroglyph in Ancient Egypt and was sacred to the Goddess Selket, who had either the body of a scorpion and the head of a woman, or (more usually) the body of a woman with a scorpion sitting on her head. The power of this Goddess resided in her ability to wield the power of the scorpion against her enemies; however, she could also use this power as protection from scorpions, too.

    "description": "Lying on its belly close to the earth, limbless, hairless, and coldblooded, the serpent represents the opposite end of the scale to the loftier spiritual heights to which Man aspires. The snake, or serpent, is arguably one of the most prominent animal symbols, and carries with it diverse and contradictory meanings. Some of those contradictory messages include the serpent as a symbol of evil but also of healing powers; of cunning and also of wisdom; as a life form that is so base that it must be capable of reaching the greatest of spiritual heights. The serpent is considered, unsurprisingly, to be a phallic symbol, yet is also one of the oldest emblems of female power, seen, for example, held in the hands of the priestesses on Knossos as a symbol of their wisdom and power. This image brings to mind the latter-day snake handlers of certain charismatic churches in the United States, who believe that so long as they have faith then the snake will not bite them. The dichotomy of the serpent symbol is embodied in the story of Adam and Eve. Demonized as an evil influence (the Devil himself) that persuades Eve to offer the forbidden fruit of knowledge to Adam, this fruit nevertheless contains knowledge and in eating it, the pair open their eyes to a wider world. As a phallic symbol, the snake also makes Adam and Eve aware of their own sexuality, and the first thing they do after this realization is to cover their genitalia with fig leaves. The serpent is a symbol of regeneration, reincarnation, and of healing powers. Evidence of the god-like status of the snake to the Native Americans, too, is evident in structures such as the 4000-year-old Serpent Mound in Ohio. To Native Americans the snake was a dangerous creature, which deserved respect at the same time as suspicion. In fact, such was the reputation of the snake for telling lies and weaving deceit that the forked tongue of the creature was adopted as a description fitted to untrustworthy people, namely, the white man.",

The idea of spinning and weaving is also an attribute of the Fates, in both Greek mythology and in the Qu’ran. Native Americans called the spider the “Thinking Woman,” who has the power to both make the world and destroy it if it is not to her satisfaction. Because of its ability to move in different dimensions, the spider was used as a means of divination. The African bird-eating spider is particularly skilled in this art, apparently, and symbols are placed at the entrance to its home in such a way that the spider will disturb them as it enters and exits.

    "description": "The very word “tiger” conjures up notions of fierceness, swiftness, and also great beauty. To fight like a tiger is to fight with great savagery. In China, the tiger, rather than the lion, is the King of the Beasts. Like the lion, it symbolizes nobility, power, ferocity, and authority. The tiger is also somehow seen as an angry animal; this is partly explained by the legend of the first tiger, said to have been a young boy, whipped many times by his teacher hence the stripes, who was pushed too far, escaped into the forest in a furious rage and transformed into the animal. For any warrior, to eat tiger meat or to wear the skin of the tiger is said to give dominion over the beast. A remnant of this belief is borne out by the image of the old buffer in his pith helmet standing on the head of the tiger-skin rug, demonstrating the power of his “superior” male ego in the slaying of the beast. Women were forbidden to eat tiger meat in case it made them wayward or difficult to control. There are parallels between the wolf and the tiger, too, as a symbol of raw sexuality. Chinese myth has a story very similar to the West’s Little Red Riding Hood, which features a tiger in the place of the wolf, and there are stories of a fearsome creature called a weretiger, a nocturnal monster that is driven to terrible acts by the appearance of the full Moon. The tiger is believed to be a shape-shifter, and certain human beings have the power to transform themselves into the beast. The savage power of the tiger also makes it a symbol of protection; it would be a very great asset to have this animal on your side, especially since they are supposed to be able to consume evil spirits with no adverse effects. Because of this, effigies of tigers were placed on graves. The tiger is a very good mother and will defend her cub to the death. The dichotomy of the tiger symbolism—as a savage creature that also protects—is demonstrated perfectly by its place in Buddhist belief. Along with the monkey (symbolizing greed) and the deer (symbolizing lovesickness), the tiger, representing anger, is one of the Three Senseless Creatures of Chinese Buddhism.",

    "description": "The turtle may appear to be an innocuous and rather unresponsive slow-moving household pet, but to ancient man it was a living collection of secret and sacred symbols, and as such, it was accorded the same kind of reverence as the greatest Gods. The four sturdy legs of the turtle represent the four elements and the four directions. These legs support the flat underside of the creature, which represents the Earth. The dome-shaped shell of the turtle represents the vault of the Heavens. Thus the turtle carries the Universe, a task shared by other sacred creatures such as the whale and the dragon. This is represented in the Hindu cosmogram or map of the Universe, shown here. The cosmos-supporting turtle is linked in Hindu iconography to Vishnu, who is said to have emerged from the waters of creation carrying the Earth on his back. In Native American belief the World Tree grows out of the back of the turtle. In alchemy, the turtle represents the Prima Materia or Massa Confusa, the Confused Mass, the first stage in the transformation of matter to spirit.",

    "description": "The remarkable story of Jonah and the whale is really a story of initiation, a symbolic death, and rebirth. The whale in this story was originally referred to as a fish, as it was in many old stories. Jonah had been chosen by God as a prophet, but was quite understandably shy of telling the people of Ninevah that judgement would soon be upon them for their wicked ways, so he took to the sea to avoid this duty. When a violent storm arose, the sailors decided to throw Jonah into the sea in order to propitiate the Gods. Instantly, the waters calmed, and there appeared a huge “fish” that swallowed Jonah. After three days and nights in the pitch dark innards of this fish, Jonah decided that he had had enough, and that it would be easier to give the prophesy than spend any more time inside the whale. In a fortunate case of either serendipity or divine intervention, Jonah was regurgitated not far from where he needed to be. Jonah is not the only character to have had the misfortune to spend time inside a whale. This particular form of initiation was the fate of several Gods and mythic heroes, from Japan, Vietnam, and Polynesia through to Finland. Jonah described the insides of the whales as sheol, meaning “the pit,” so the gaping jaw of the whale is symbolic of the gates of hell. The stomach of the whale also becomes a symbolic womb that gives birth to Jonah. It is significant, too, that Christ spent the same amount of time inside the tomb before he, too, was reborn; therefore the legend of Jonah’s whale was said to prophesy Christ’s ordeal. Whale hunting is a controversial subject. However, for the Inuit people who have been involved in this practice for thousands of years and so know the animal very well, the whale is the trickster. There is a myth that a beautiful woman, who occasionally entertains mariners, lives in a lavishly furnished apartment inside the belly of the whale, a story no doubt invented to comfort a drowning man.",

    "description": "The wolf that disguises itself as the grandmother in the tale of Little Red Riding Hood shows the creature as a trickster, with malevolent intentions. However, the disguise isn’t very good and the little girl recognizes the wolf by its easily identifiable features—huge teeth and massive eyes—and so makes good her escape. Here, the wolf is also a sexual predator, another emblem of the animal that has endured since ancient times; the “wolf whistle” is aptly named and the tendencies of the wolf itself are well known. Like the wolf in the fairytale, its true nature is impossible to disguise for long, just like the proverbial “wolf in sheep’s clothing.” The wolf also has a reputation of being a loner, hunting not in packs but singly. In Greece, it was associated with the Gods Zeus and Apollo as a symbol of masculine power, energy, and sexuality. The Egyptians, too, worshipped the wolf, at the city of Lycopolis, which was even named for the creature. Here, the wolf also acted as a psychopomp, a creature that guided the souls of the dead into the Afterlife. Anubis, the greatest of all the conductors of souls, had the head of a wolf or of a wild dog or jackal. The God of Time, Chronos, has a wolf-like face, symbolizing the monster that devours human time. It was a wolf that suckled Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. Despite this maternal care, the word lupa meant “prostitute” as well as “she-wolf” and the Lupercal Temples were effectively brothels. Continuing with this theme, there’s a saying in France that if a girl is a virgin she is said to n’a jamais vu le loup, i.e. to have never seen the wolf; the opposite is true for a girl who has lost her virginity. The werewolf is arguably the most sinister aspect of this creature. Warlocks were believed to be able to transform into wolves in order to disguise themselves when they traveled to their unholy meetings, and the belief in a wolf/human hybrid is prevalent throughout much of the world.",

According to Rudolf Steiner, the present astrological era denotes a shift toward more holistic, spiritual understanding of reality. The Seal depicts the Aquarian quality of cosmic attunement and universal consciousness. The six-pointed star represents the union of opposites – spirit with matter, Heaven with Earth, the divine within the human.

    "description": "The Fifth Apocalyptic Seal described in Revelation depicts souls under an altar crying out for justice. Anthroposophy interprets this symbolically as the effects of one’s life choices and actions. Rather than punishment from an external authority, the Fifth Seal represents karmic consequences – the universal law that our deeds shape future experiences. The souls under the altar signify people seeking resolution for wrongs committed against them. In Anthroposophy, the altar symbolizes the threshold between the physical and spiritual realms. The souls beneath it exist in a transitional karmic state, having died but still impacted by unresolved worldly acts. Their cries express the longing for redemption through moral compensation. Meditating on the Fifth Seal provides deep insight into karma, reincarnation and the continuity of the soul. It represents the importance of ethical living for spiritual progress between lifetimes. Resolving past wrongs can enable the soul’s ascent. On a cultural level, the Seal signifies a coming era where outdated institutions collapse as humanity recognizes interdependence.

It depicts a man in white robes with molten metal feet and a flaming sword protruding from his mouth. Circling his right hand are the astrological symbols for Saturn, Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus. The sword symbolizes an evolutionary secret – the future transformation of the human physical form. Discourse is often contrasted with the sword, yet in esoteric terms the imagery is literal, not just poetic metaphor. Anthroposophy sees an occult connection between present-day humanity’s lower reproductive drives and our larynx-produced speech. The First Seal reveals that future spiritual evolution will elevate and transform those forces into creative power expressed through the Word. The molten metal feet suggest spiritualization of the body’s foundation. The planets represent cosmic forces imprinting human consciousness and destiny. The man’s white garment signifies purified soul essence. Meditating on the First Apocalyptic Seal provides insight into humanity’s path from unconscious instinct to conscious co-creation.

It signifies the emergence of the ‘awareness soul’ – a critical milestone in human evolution according to Rudolf Steiner. The Seal depicts the rise of self-consciousness, individuality and personal responsibility. While this individualized ego is a necessary stage, it can also engender issues like materialism and selfishness when severed from the spiritual realm. The winged angel symbolizes the soul awakening to its own identity and acquiring personal will. The flames around the angel suggest the perils of this state when not guided by wisdom. According to Anthroposophy, exercising the awareness soul correctly leads to conscious alignment with the divine will, enabling co-creation. But it also risks being trapped in personality desires versus enacting soul purpose. Meditating on the multilayered Fourth Seal provides insight on actualizing spiritual individuality. It teaches discernment to become an ego guided from within versus controlled by outer impulses. On a cultural level, the Seal represents both the peak of the egoic age and transition toward spiritual community. As humanity integrates lessons of individualism, capacities like empathy and synthesis develop. For Anthroposophy, the Fourth Seal charts the odyssey of self-realization. Its symbols provide occult insight to navigate opportunities and perils upon the path to enlightenment.",

According to Anthroposophy, the Seal can serve as a contemplative tool to connect with Mercury’s spiritual qualities and integrate them into one’s life. The Mercury Seal is believed to invoke Mercury’s energies of change, transition and uniting opposites. Mercury represents the unification of all polarities – masculine and feminine, thinking and feeling, spirit and matter. The two overlapping triangles symbolize the integration of contrasts – ascending and descending, the human and divine, the macrocosm and microcosm. The triangles converge to form a six-pointed star, representing spiritual evolution through harmonizing polarities. The Mercury Seal is often used protectively to ward off harmful spiritual forces. For the Anthroposophist, meditating on the Seal opens one to Mercury’s change-bringing impulse while also providing spiritual protection during transformation.

The crescent moons and inverted triangle represent waxing and waning forces. The points signify sun forces streaming in, transformed within, and radiating outward. The center circle embodies harmonizing power enabling balanced exchange. For Anthroposophists, the rich Moon Seal symbol signifies one’s dynamic integration with the cosmos – absorbing nourishment, transforming within, and sharing wisdom.

More broadly, the Lamb symbolizes the ‘Christ consciousness’ within every individual. According to Anthroposophy, humankind will gradually transform into a peaceful, harmonious society guided by this universal Christ consciousness. The Mystical Lamb embodies this future state of enlightened ‘group soul.’ The sacrifice of the Lamb makes this evolutionary leap possible by reconciling humanity’s spiritual and material natures. The four creatures – Eagle, Lion, Bull, Man – represent four epochs that lead to this enlightened era. In Anthroposophy, one’s moral development should progress through these epochs from instinct (Bull), to courage (Lion), to rationality (Man), to love (Eagle). Like the evolving epochs, the seven seals depict cosmic evolution from Old Saturn to Future Vulcan.

In Anthroposophy, it signifies spiritual renewal, transition and the passage from old to new. The duality of the fish symbolizes the ego and universal self, seeming to move apart yet ultimately united in the cosmic flow. Anthroposophy associates Pisces with the mystic death of the individual ego and rebirth into an enlightened state of unity. Letting go of the smaller sense of self allows one to dissolve into the vaster consciousness of the universe. This surrender of ego-identification is seen as a crucial stage of spiritual development. The Pisces Seal represents the soul’s cycle of incarnation – death of the limited personality leading to rebirth in wider awareness. It encourages fluidity, faith in larger cosmic forces and trust in the unknown. For the meditating Anthroposophist, the Pisces Seal provides insight into spiritual liberation. By contemplating its symbols, one can align with archetypal energies of dissolution, renewal and transcendence of the egoic self. On a cultural level, this Seal signifies humanity’s collective journey towards enlightenment. As the ego-centric Piscean age gives way to the Aquarian, unity and universality emerge.

    "description": "The Saturn Seal is a profound emblem in Anthroposophy representing the convergence of spiritual and material realms and the evolution of human consciousness. It is associated with the planet Saturn, considered a spiritual force fostering enlightenment. The Seal’s triangular motifs signify the descent of spirit into matter, mind into body, and divine will into action. The upper triangle depicts the macrocosm, the lower microcosm. Together they represent the cosmic imprinting of spiritual energies into physical form. The Saturn Seal serves meditative and contemplative purposes. Focusing on the emblem facilitates communication with the archetypal Saturnian energies of initiation, discipline, and transcendence. The Seal can also be incorporated into sacred architecture, rituals, and other creations as a talismanic focus point. For the Anthroposophist, the Saturn Seal encapsulates the process of spiritual awakening and actualization. It serves as a symbolic conduit for the Saturnian impulse which compels humans to transform consciousness through rigorous self-development. By meditating on the Seal, one connects with the transcendent force that guides the evolution of body, soul and spirit. The multifaceted Saturn Seal represents the integration of heavenly powers with earthly manifestations. Anthroposophy utilizes this evocative symbol to attune practitioners to cosmological energies which facilitate the ascent of consciousness and self-realization.

    "description": "In Anthroposophy, the Second Apocalyptic Seal relates to the concept of “etherization of the blood,” representing a pivotal stage in human spiritual evolution. According to Rudolf Steiner, the etheric body – a subtle energy field interpenetrating the physical body – is becoming more active and perceptible in people. The etheric body and blood are intimately connected. As the etheric body awakens, it transforms the blood’s qualities and functions. Steiner believed this etherization of the blood would profoundly impact society and culture, giving rise to new forms of spirituality, science, and art. The Second Seal depicts a red bull, representing the vigorous etheric forces stimulating the blood and inner drives. The rainbow above symbolizes enlightened transformation of these primal energies into higher capacities like creativity and compassion. For Anthroposophists, meditating on the Second Seal provides insight into the etheric dimension and its role in spiritual growth. It represents the integration of our animal nature with the developing higher self. On a cultural scale, the Seal signifies emerging global empathy, intuition and ecological awareness. Humanity is entering an era where materialism transforms into conscious cooperation with natural forces. The Seal marks the dawn of spiritually enlightened civilization. The profound Second Apocalyptic Seal distills Anthroposophy’s vision of human progress through integrating our etheric and physical natures. By raising consciousness, we gain positive power over innate drives and desires. The Seal charts the next stage in realization of humankind’s cosmic destiny.",

    "description": "The Seventh Apocalyptic Seal depicts a serpent with the Mercury staff and an upturned cup. The serpent symbolizes the selfless, devoted attitude required to grasp spiritual wisdom. The spiraling staff represents the Cosmic Mercury forces that can only be accessed through such an awakened consciousness. The downward-facing cup signifies humanity’s future spiritual purification and the reversal of its current sensualistic orientation. Presently, humans live consumed by base desires, with cups ‘freely pointing upward.’ The Seal foretells an era where humanity’s cup becomes ‘chaste,’ turning inward rather than chasing external gratification. The plant’s upright cup below embodies the opposite state – openness to freely receive spiritual nourishment from the heavens. The evolution implied is one of tuning human desire forces to divine will. Meditating on the Seventh Seal provides insight into overcoming ego-centered cravings by aligning with cosmic wisdom. The serpent symbolizes esoteric knowledge available to the humbly devoted. In Anthroposophy, the Seal charts the path to enlightenment through purification of desires. Culturally, the Seal represents the culmination of humanity’s spiritual journey – the reunification of mortal consciousness with the divine. Sensuality transmutes into selfless love. The fallen cup becomes the Holy Grail, brimming with wisdom and compassion.",

It represents an esoteric interpretation of apocalyptic prophecy as an era of transition, not literal worldwide destruction. The Seal symbolizes the emergence of new spiritual energies and dissolution of old structures. Human consciousness is evolving beyond conventional limits and belief systems. This brings a crisis and the collapse of outdated institutions. Yet the Seal also signifies rebirth – the potential for enlightened civilization to emerge from the ashes of materialism. The angel with the seal of God on its forehead represents divine vision awakening. The moon turning to blood suggests purification of humanity’s astral body and lower drives. For Anthroposophists, meditating on Seal Six provides insight into managing chaotic transitions on the path to spiritual awakening. Upheaval is seen as a necessary step in collective human ascent. As outdated modalities crumble, space opens for enlightened ones to guide reconstruction.

Venus correlates to harmony, beauty and the feminine divine according to Rudolf Steiner’s teachings. The Seal signifies a phase in humanity’s evolution toward higher spiritual consciousness. Anthroposophy holds that the Venus Seal radiates a balancing, harmonizing effect on its environment. For this reason, the symbol is often incorporated into Anthroposophic art and architecture. The two interlocking circles represent the synthesis of opposites – masculine and feminine, spirit and matter. The hexagram depicts the macrocosm’s imprint on the microcosm. The upper and lower triangles signify descending spirit manifesting through ascending matter. For the Anthroposophist, meditating on the multidimensional Venus Seal provides access to Venusian spiritual energies of equilibrium and grace.

For example, during the auspicious Spring Festival, fish is prepared and left uneaten by families. This is to represent the desire to have extra, or surplus during the year. Because the fish are able to live a long life, they are connected with the idea of longevity. And their behavior of swimming in pairs leads to the connection of unity and loyalty.

She played a prominent role in the afterlife judgment of Osiris. The center of the Maat cult was in the Theban necropolis. Since the ancient Egyptians believed that each deceased had to appear before 42 judges and plead innocent or guilty of sins, the soul of the deceased was weighed on the scales, balanced by the ostrich feather of the goddess Maat. Libra was held by Anubis and the verdict was pronounced by the husband of Maat, the god Thoth. If the heart was burdened with crimes, the monster Amtu, a lion with the head of a crocodile, devoured the deceased. If the deceased lived his life “with Maat in his heart”, was pure and sinless, then he revived for a happy life in the fields of paradise. Maat was usually depicted with a feather in her hair, which she placed on the scales at the trial. It was believed that people live “thanks to Maat, in Maat and for Maat.”",

It was believed that it was he who endows men with sexual strength, the power to give birth to a son.

The Greek letter tau, which is the nineteenth in the alphabet, is referred to as a triple tau. The triple tau in Royal Arch Masonry comprises three Ts that are united at their bases and connected in the middle. This mythological figure can be represented in many ways. First off, the names Hiram of Tyre and Hiram Abif have the same letters “H” and “T” in Phoenician, as they do in English. As a result, the Triple Tau adopts the meaning of Hiram Abif’s name’s initials. In addition, it stands for T. H., Templum Hierolym, the Temple of Jerusalem. When employed as the Royal Arch emblem, certain jurisdictions teach the bearer to accept himself as a servant of God. Third, a tau cross was once used by Christians who were under Greek or Roman influence. In early church history, the trinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit served as the foundation for a triple tau. Many faiths and religions share the belief in the triune character of the Godhead.",

It is one of the first plants to reemerge after snowmelt, lighting the landscape with its lush colors. For the Inuit, the Aupilaktunnguat serves as a resilient symbol of endurance in harsh climes. It is fitting that this special flora has been selected as Nunavut’s emblem. Just as the saxifrage plant has numerous uses important to Inuit traditions, so too does the territory rely on multifaceted relationships with the natural world. The Aupilaktunnguat’s deep cultural significance and ability to thrive make it an ideal representative of Inuit Ingirinaturutaujanngittualuk – core values of adaptability and communal interdependence upon the Arctic environment.",

The piece exhibits compositional harmony, with the tail feathers nearly taking up the same amount of area as the bird’s body. It is one of Canada’s most well-known pieces of art. She used the animals and flowers of her surroundings as major sources of inspiration. The first printing came in two color options: 25 copies, each of red and black and green and black. The stone for The Enchanted Owl and several of Kinngait’s other well-known prints were carved by Iyola Kingwatsiak.",

Derived from the Inuktitut word “iglu“, meaning “dwelling“, this traditional shelter showcases indigenous ingenuity. By carefully compacting powder into interlocking blocks, inhabitants construct a sheltered dome capable of trapping body heat against bitterly frigid winds. Within an igloo’s insulated walls, families find warmth and comfort through community. Transparent ice panels allow sunlight to stream in, banishing darkness. Soft piles of fur and hide serve as bedding beneath caribou-skin doors keeping out drafts. More than just a temporary refuge from blizzards, igloos represent the Inuit relationship to their environment. Through close study of material properties, generations passed down how to mold the essence of this terrain into a safe home. Even today, camping in igloos connects youth to ancestral wisdom. The foundations of this architectural marvel, continually rebuilt each season, stand as a reminder that cultural survival depends on harmony with the land itself.

On March 30th, 1999, this carved symbol of authority was unveiled publicly for the first time in the main assembly hall of the legislative building. Crafted from locales stone and Labradorite, the mace is grasped firmly yet gently in the hands of a male and female figurine. For the Inuit, the representation of both genders indicates the values of equality and mutual respect that are fundamental to their society. At the opening of each new session, the mace leads a procession to mark the convening of parliamentary business. Carried aloft on the right shoulder of the Sergeant-at-Arms, it is trailed by pages turning the fingers of apprenticeship and clerks ensuring due process. When borne at a lower level, it denotes a time of recess or committee debate. Yet raised on high beneath the chamber’s soaring roof beams, the mace signifies supreme authority resting with the Speaker’s chair. This symbol has evolved greatly from its original form as a practical weapon of defense. Born in the courts of 12th century England and France as the arms of royal protection, the mace was wielded by guards charged with the monarch’s safety. Now repurposed as an emblem of enabling governance, it watches over the Legislative Assembly with steadfast vigilance. As with Inuit cultural traditions, the mace adapts to new purposes while retaining ties to the heritage and principles of its origins. Its stature represents both the sovereign powers and communal spirit of legislative democracy in Nunavut.",

For millennia, the origins and fate of this Arctic breed have been intertwined with the Inuit people. Archaeological clues suggest a shared history stretching back thousands of years to the PaleoInuit culture. However, it was under the venerable Thule Civilization that the relationship between canine and human was truly forged. Around 800 years ago, the Thule adapted sled technology, recognizing the Qimmiq’s potential for transport over frozen tundra. As they migrated across the Bering Strait, so too did these resilient dogs pull their people’s belongings into new frontier territories. More than mere utility, Qimmiqs possess traits central to Inuit wisdom. Their incredible adaptability allowed exploration of even the harshest landscapes. As devoted hunters, protectors from polar bears, and willing packmates, they have proven themselves vital companions for survival in the Arctic Circle. To this day, the Canadian Inuit Dog remains intrinsically linked to its people. Whether accompanying nomadic herders or guarding modern settlements, the bond between Inuit and Qimmiq endures across eras. Few symbols better represent the Inuit relationship to their challenging homeland and to the ever-faithful guardians who braved its icy realm at their people’s side. The inseparable history of this noble breed will continue to be celebrated as an embodiment of strength, partnership and cultural heritage.",

To bring back soil to form land, several creatures sought to swim to the ocean’s bottom. Muskrat was successful in accumulating dirt, which was then put on a turtle’s back. The turtle became larger because of the dirt’s proliferation. The turtle kept becoming bigger and bigger, and the soil kept growing until it was a vast area of land.

Before the battle, Nobunaga stopped to pray at a temple. And while making an offering of five copper coins at part of the ritual, all five coins landed face up, signaling a future victory.",

Nonetheless, Fukushima Masanori was a warrior during battles and awarded several stipends and honors throughout his life. After his military display during the Korean Campaign wherein he took Chongju, Masanori was awarded even higher stipends and more honors. However, as years passed Masanori sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara. This alliance helped ensure that his domains would survive and he would continue to rule. Later on, he did lose his holding but his descendants were able to continue on. Masanori’s descendants ultimately became hatamoto in the service of the Tokugawa shōgun.",

A stable transition towards peace left him, like many other warriors during this time, disillusioned and unable to fit into this new political climate after so many years of battle. However, his years of service meant that he was considered one of the best generals to serve Tokugawa Ieyasu.

One of Hideyoshi’s followers, Yoshitsugu had a strong reputation in battle and military matters. He was also known for both his bravery and loyalty. Despite being in poor physical condition later in life, Yoshitsugu fought important battles alongside his closest allies and friends in whatever capacity he was able to. Yoshitsugu also suffered from leprosy, which further exacerbated his health issues. Yoshitsugu, and the Otani clan in general are one of the more ambiguous clans during this time because of a lack of sources around them. There is not much information on the Otani clan and their member’s names, origins, or ages. Coupled with very little administrative records of the Otani clan, tracing their history back can be more difficult compared to some of the other clans of this period.",

The skull and crossbones flag may have gained greater widespread recognition as the “Jolly Roger” because of its affiliation with Bartholomew Roberts, who flew it among other flags aboard his fleet of ships.",

His “black flag,” which had a recognizable skull and crossbones design, was enhanced with another typical pirate symbol, an hourglass, to warn his target that time was running out and that the only way to avoid death was to surrender promptly. There were no other accounts of pirates flying comparable flags, but within 15 years, the skull and crossbones motif and its many variations would come to represent all Golden Age pirates.",

Its essence was that all men of the same family, having gathered in the temple, alternately pierced their penises with a sharp spike, and through the holes they made they passed a string or rope. One common for all. According to the Maya, the soul and life energy were in the blood. Finding themselves thus “strung” on a rope soaked in common blood; they symbolized union with their divine ancestors. Later this rite began to be practiced among women. They pierced their tongues.",

    "description": "Artha is the concept of true order in Avesta and ancient religions (Avestian – asha, ancient Persian – artha, ancient Indian – Rta). The universal moral law of the universe Artha, materialized in light and fire, opposed the embodiment of lies, darkness, ritual filth – the Drug (created by Angro-Manyu). These images are close to the Vedic ideas about the cosmic law – Rta and go back to the common Indo-European prototypes. The Indo-European traditions are characterized by a sharp dualism of good and evil, the good spirits Ahura led by Ahura Mazda and the devas (monsters) led by Angro-Manyu, who brought sins, illnesses, death to the world created by Ahura Mazda and seek to destroy the good that, however, indestructibly and ultimately triumph over evil. Dualism was also inherent in the rest of the world – it was divided into the earthly (corporeal) and spiritual (otherworldly) spheres, where the struggle of good and evil forces also took place. The Ahura of the Seven Chapters has wives, called Ahuranis, who, like Varuna’s Varunanis, are rain clouds and waters. Ahura is possessor of Asha, as Varuna is custodian of Rta (“Truth” or “cosmic order” = Asha = Old Persian. Arta). The sun is the “eye” of both deities, and the name of Ahura is at times joined to that of the god Mithra.",

    "description": "Asha is one of the basic concepts of Zoroastrianism. It can denote both the natural order of things – the law of universal harmony, and its ethical side: truth and goodness. Ahura Mazda was considered the parent of Asha. The concept is close to Arta (Rta), but more ancient and goes back to the Avesta tradition. The concept of “asha” in the teachings of Zoroastrianism was opposed to the concept of “drug” – “lie, untruth”: in moral terms, people were divided into “ashavan” – the righteous and “drugvant” – “adherents of evil”. Asha – order or law, which is the basis of the universe, circles of being revolve around asha. For a righteous person, the law was to be a “good thought,” a “good word,” and a “good deed.” In the most ancient hymns of the Avesta, the concept of “asha” is used in several aspects: 1) what is true and truthful, the kingdom of truth and order belonging to Ahura Mazda, sacred, eternal law, divine order; 2) corresponding to sacred law – righteous deeds, good deeds; 3) legitimate claim, including the claim of a person belonging to the Zoroastrian religion for eternal good.",

In Persia, the serpent Azi-Dahak is the “strangler”, the enemy of the sun god. With the advent of Islam, the symbolism changed. The snake in Islam is closely associated with life and represents el-hayyah and vital el-hyat, as well as El-Hay – one of the most important names of God, meaning “revival”, or that which gives a vital beginning. So the snake is that which at the same time animates and supports, endows with life, is the very principle of life. Therefore, on traditional Persian carpets, the snake symbol is most often associated with wisdom and guardian.",

Symbolizing the she-wolf who, according to Roman myth & legend, nursed Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, these statues are often found sculpted from bronze or marble. Legend has it that Romulus and Remus were children of the god Mars and the princess Rhea Silvia. Abandoned on the banks of the Tiber river and saved by a she-wolf, the twins were then raised by a shepherd. After the twins founded the city of Rome on the seven hills, the she-wolf swiftly came to symbolize their connection to both the wild and the new city of Rome. The statue was associated with the Capitoline Hill, the sacred hill of Rome, from which its name derives. The Capitoline she-wolf is often depicted in a protective pose with Romulus and Remus crouching beneath her. Its statues soon became an emblem of power and identity for ancient Rome; a legacy which lives on to this day. The Capitoline she-wolf continues to define Roman culture and art, representing the mythical foundations of the city and its foundational link to maternal strength and protection.",

The first colonizers of Magna Grecia imported this plant to the lands where it soon spread like wildfire, becoming a cultural symbol which, in part, remains to this day. Judging by the depictions of vines in their tombs, historians believe the Etruscans are the ones who spread the grapevine throughout the region.

Inspired by its ability to wrap and grow around trees and columns, the ivy plant suggested an endless cycle of rebirth and regeneration, spurring the plant’s symbolism of immortality and eternal life. This symbolic importance led to its inclusion in fertility celebrations and those related to the continuity of life. Like the grapevine, ivy was entangled with the mythology of Dinoysius / Bacchus in ancient Greece and Rome. Ivy garlands, wreaths and leaves became a commonplace means of honouring the God. Ivy wreaths were worn during Bacchic festivals as a sign of joy, while ivy leaves could be used to decorate wine vessels. Ivy garlands were commonly used to decorate temples, statues, altars and homes during religious holidays and ceremonies, symbolizing prosperity, joy and abundance. It was a versatile and meaningful symbol, associated with eternal life, joy, abundance, love and faithfulness. In Roman mythology, ivy was also entwined with the concepts of love and loyalty. It is said that ivy grew around the tomb of Cupid and Psyche, symbolizing eternal love and marital fidelity.",

Born in 100 BC. in a patrician family, Caesar marked history with his political, military and literary ability. From a young age, Caesar is claimed to have demonstrated extraordinary intelligence and an unparalleled sense of determination. Thanks to his sharp rhetoric, diplomatic skill and natural ability to build alliances with those who crossed his path, Caesar’s political career came with many swift advancements, and he rose rapidly through the Roman hierarchies. Caesar’s greatest claim to fame came during his work as a military commander. Under his leadership, a number of astounding victories were made during the conquest to extend the Roman Empire to the Western borders of Europe. His campaign in Gaul offers an exceptional example of Caesar’s unparalleled tactical and strategic skill whilst defeating the Celtic and Germanic tribes. In addition to his military exploits, Caesar was a social and political reformer. Despite only a short stint as Rome’s dictator, Caesar introduced a number of reforms which sought to improve the conditions of Roman lives, including land laws and calendar reforms. But this only riled more controversy. Even as dictator, Caesar was no stranger to opposition. His seizure of absolute power and the transformation of the Roman Republic into an Empire under his command was sometimes seen as a threat to freedom and the Roman republican tradition. But despite his popularity spreading like wildfire, Caesar met his fate in 44 BC at the hands of conspirators. Whilst marking the end of an era, Caesar’s assassination is ascribed to the subsequent period of instability in Rome which led to the rise of Augustus and the founding of the Roman Empire. Caesar remains one of Western history’s most iconic figures, celebrated throughout the centuries for his conquests and long list of achievements. But his legacy comes stained with debate and controversy, spurred by his role in the fall of the Roman Republic.",

Prized and revered for its longevity, resistance and, most importantly, its fruit, olive trees are in fact native to the Mediterranean region, making it a solid national symbol. Olive trees and their fruits became deeply entangled within Roman culture, adapted into nutrition, hygiene and even ceremonial and religious purposes. Associated with peace, prosperity and divine protection, the olive tree wove itself naturally throughout daily Roman life, appearing across ancient art, politics and religion. The olive tree was closely tied to Minerva, the goddess of war, wisdom and the arts. Its link with Minerva’s facets of peace and prosperity were so deeply entrenched that the olive tree often appeared as a symbol of peace and harmony. During religious ceremonies, olive leaves were woven into garlands to decorate altars and statues whilst symbolizing divine protection and purity. Olive wreaths would also be awarded as prizes to the winners of sports games, representing victory and honour. The symbolisms behind the olive tree encompass harmony and abundance, stemming into the perks of prosperity, fertility and wealth. Its silvery leaves epitomised the Roman’s allure towards rebirth and vitality, leading olive branches to appear on various coins and coats of arms. The symbolisms of the olive tree also crossed over into Roman politics. During war and conflict, the offering of an olive branch symbolized a gesture of peace and reconciliation between the conflicting parties; a sentiment so poignant that it is still reflected today in modern political iconography, such as the United Nations logo.",

Cassius Dio Cocceiano lists it with the Basilica of Neptune and the Laconian Gymnasium among the works built at his expense by Agrippa in the Campus Martius. Subsequently the temple collapsed and was rebuilt by Hadrian, perhaps at the hands of the architect Apollodorus with the result that we can see today. On the building, there is the Latin inscription “Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, consul for the third time, built” — but in reality, Agrippa built the first version of the Colosseum, which is not today’s version. Its original structure, as seen from the excavations carried out for its maintenance, consisted of an almost square temple, wider than it was long, designed in Greek style and consecrated to the seven Roman deities.",

The symbol of pomegranate was linked to the cults of the Sacred Mysteries, so much so that in the archaic Greek myth Persephone eats seven pomegranate seeds in Hades, which forces her to live six months in the world of the dead before spending another six months in splendor of Olympus. In all ancient religions, the descent into Hades was considered to represent the awareness of life in a man unafraid to explore his unconscious depths. Therefore, the mysterious meaning of the pomegranate was the awareness of life, and life beyond life. Pomegranate seeds were widely used in magic and had the function of strengthening the created enchantment, both in healing spells and curses intended to cause harm to others.",

The lyre was discovered during the 1926–1927 season of an archaeological dig conducted by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania in what is now Iraq. The dig took place in the Royal Cemetery of Ur and was overseen by Leonard Woolley.",

Initially employed to record transactions for simple products, cuneiform gradually developed into a more complicated written language that served several functions. Cuneiform was originally a pictographic writing system in which each character represented a miniature image of a concept. Until they assumed a more symbolic shape, these pictures underwent increasing simplification and codification. Cuneiform was a writing system that could be used in several languages; it wasn’t a language.",

Usually it is a composite creature with the head of a rooster, the body of a man, and the legs of snakes and scorpions; carrying a whip and a shield. Gnostics identified the image of Abraxas with Yahweh (in the Greek version – “Iao”). Amulets and seals depicting Abraxas were popular in the 2nd century AD. Some of these stones survived until the Middle Ages. Abraxas appears on the seal of the Grand Master of the Templars in the French Rite of 1214. The image of Abraxas was probably transferred to the seals of the Templars from more ancient stones. The use of Abraxas on seals did not generate accusations of Gnosticism during the period of the Templars’ persecution, which indicates a complete absence in their midst of any beliefs or rituals that could be interpreted as Gnostic.",

Anselm stated that the Turks “called loudly upon Baphomet.” Most scholars believe that the word refers to Muhammad, the founder of Islam. In 1307 Philip IV of France had every Templar in France arrested, accusing them of such heretical acts as idolatrous worship of a bearded male head called Baphomet.

For example, the word “Bosean” itself meant not only the name of the battle cloth, it was also used as the battle cry of the Knights of the Templars. Bosean (Bauseant) translated into Latin from the language “Ok” means Sancta Rosa, Holy Rose. In addition, the ratio of white to black on the canvas is three to one: 70% white and 30% black, and the height and base of the cloth are related to each other according to the “golden ratio”. The real meaning of Beauceant is not exactly known, but it could have happened that the black part depicted the sins of the world, and the white symbolized the purity that the Knights Templar offered. Whatever the symbolism, the Beauceant was very powerful – while it was still flying, the knights were not allowed to retreat or end the battle.",

The main thing is that the red cross must be present on the clothing of the Templars. It was the red cross that was considered the official symbol of the Templars, although crosses of other colors were also used. The Pope and the King of France introduced a rule according to which knights were required to wear symbols at all times – under pain of a ban on the use of water or food. There are various explanations for the choice of exactly the red cross. The most common version is associated with the personality of Pope Urban II, who sent the knights-pilgrims to the second crusade. Then the campaigns were not yet called crusades. But once the Pope, to inspire the warriors-pilgrims, allegedly tore a crimson cape on himself and began to distribute pieces of it, and they sewed these strips in the form of a cross for themselves. As a result, the campaign was called a crusade, and subsequently the knights of different orders also used red crosses in their symbolism.",

In the heraldic tradition of the Templars, they are also used, and here, too, the influence of Muslim culture on the crusaders is clearly visible.

At the cathedral, to test the guilt of the accused, their cloaks were thrown into the fire, but the Templar cross on none of them was on fire. Judging by the records of the medieval chronicler Matthew of Paris, by the 13th century the cross of St. George was established among the English crusaders; among the French – silver or white; among Italians – a yellow or azure cross; among the Germans – black, among the Flemings – green, among the Spaniards – purple, among the Scots – a silver St. Andrew’s cross.

The design of the helmet provided protection for the head in front, from the sides and behind, the view was carried out through narrow (9-12 mm wide) viewing slots, and at short distances it was somewhat limited. Below the slits for the eyes were ventilation holes. Sometimes they made their way in orderly, forming whole patterns or images. The highest hierarchs of the Templars could punch patterns from the traditional crosses for them. On the late 14th century tophelm variety, the Kübelhelm, the vents were usually located only on the right side of the helmet, so as not to weaken the metal on the left side, which is most susceptible to enemy spears. The helmet of the Knights Templar was no different from the helmets of other knights of that period, except for the decoration with a large black cross associated with the order and small crosses around the perimeter (it might not have been).",

    "description": "A Templar Knight is a knight who took a vow as a knight of the Templar order and had special identifying marks. Relatively little is known about the founding of the Knights Templar. It is established that in 1118 nine French knights gave the Patriarch of Jerusalem a vow of chastity, poverty and obedience. They pledged to do everything in their power to protect the roads and pilgrims in Palestine from robbers and Muslims. The head of this community, combining public service with severe military discipline, a monastic lifestyle with knightly rights, selfless love for one’s neighbor with military prowess, was the noble knight Hugo de Payen. King Baldwin II of Jerusalem gave these knight-monks a part of his palace, which, according to legend, adjoined the temple of King Solomon. From that time on, they began to be called “the poor soldiers of Christ, the defenders of the Jerusalem temple” or simply “templars”.",

It is also known as the Strophalos of Hecate. Hecate’s wheel is a circle with a spiral inside of a circular labyrinth. The Moon, Earth, Sea, and Sky are the sources of inspiration and strength for this symbol. It is said to signify devotion, love, femininity, wisdom, and divine understanding.",

    "description": "The hexagram is most frequently portrayed in symbolism by two triangles that are interlocked, similar to the Star of David in Jewish tradition. The hexagram unicursal (drawn in a single line) is a more complex, six-sided design that is more typical of Wiccan tradition. Four auxiliary vertices—two on each side—and two primary vertices, one pointing above and one below; make up the triangle. The upward-pointing vertex is frequently thought to represent a man or the earthly world, while the highest vertex is claimed to be a representation of the Divine or the divine plane. The unicursal hexagram is two letters “Z”s, one drawn conventionally and the other with a mirror reflection overlaid such that its two edges touch. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn employed the shape, although there is very little information that truly describes how it was created. The Golden Dawn organization’s Rose Cross has the same enigmatic four triangles that appear to be sprouting from its core like the unicursal hexagram.",

The Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone are the three phases of the Goddess represented by the triple moon emblem. The waxing moon phase corresponds to the Goddess’s Maiden stage, which is her initial manifestation. This is the period of innocence and naivety. The Mother, symbolized by a full moon, is the second stage of the Goddess. She is frequently revered near the end of the harvest season. The waning moon represents the Goddess on the third level since she is the Crone. She has progressed from adolescence to wisdom. There is, however, a link between The Crone and death.",

It is an ancient and potent symbol of magic and has several metaphorical implications. For instance, the points represent the head, hands, and feet of a human being. It also symbolizes the four elements of air, water, earth and fire, as well as the fifth element of spirit. Pentacles are drawn in the air during ceremonies to invoke or expel spirits. A pentacle posture is achieved by spreading the feet apart and extending the arms straight out. Pentacle necklaces, rings, and bracelets are popular among Wiccans.",

Even though it lives inside of us, it is not a material object. Everything about spirituality and mysticism, as well as magical thinking, are drawn to and favored by the Spirit. Since spirit is a component of everything in the cosmos, it differs from the other four Elements because it lacks any special ritual or magical correspondences.

Since the Elements are the actual powers of nature, Wiccans hold them in high regard and consider them sacred. The natural rhythms of life, death, and rebirth are infused into ritual and magic, and eventually into the everyday consciousness of people who practice them. Earth, Air, Fire, and Water are the four elements that make up the material world, whereas Spirit, the fifth element, is present in all four of the other elements.",

He is born at the winter solstice, marries the Goddess at Beltane, and dies at the summer solstice. His death is a life-giving sacrifice. Most modern Witchcraft traditions stress the Goddess. However, the Horned God is vital in his role in male-female polarity. He is venerated in ceremonies through the high priest, who sometimes wears an antlered headpiece or a horned helmet. The Horned God symbolizes sexuality, vigor, hunting, reasoning, and power, but not exploitative. He is tender and compassionate.",

Its endless design, which showed neither a beginning nor a conclusion, was a significant component of its power. To shield the inhabitants from malicious intent from all angles, the four loops were made to face each of the four cardinal directions.

It also serves as a protective screen against negative energy, symbolizes the cyclicity of fire, and is excellent for meditation because of its unique shape. The triquetra frequently appears encircled by a circle or with a circle entwined with its lobes. Most symbolic traditions relate eternity and cyclicity to the circle.
